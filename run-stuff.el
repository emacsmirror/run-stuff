;;; Commentary:

;; Run commands from the region or current line,
;; with some simple specifiers to control behavior.

;;; Usage

;; (run-stuff-command-on-region-or-line)
;;
;; A command to execute the current selection or the current line
;; using the default `run-stuff-handlers' variable.
;;
;; - '$ ' Run in terminal.
;; - '@ ' Open in an Emacs buffer.
;; - '~ ' Open with default mime type (works for paths too).
;; - 'http://' or 'https://' opens in a web-browser.
;; - Open in terminal if its a directory.
;; - Default to running the command without a terminal
;;   when none of the conditions above succeed.
;;
;; Note that there is support for line splitting,
;; so long commands may be split over multiple lines.
;; This is done using the '\' character, when executing the current line
;; all surrounding lines which end with '\' will be included.
;;
;; So you can for define a shell command as follows:
;;
;; $ make \
;;   -C /my/project \
;;   --no-print-directory \
;;   --keep-going
;;
;; The entire block will be detected so you can run the command
;; with your cursor over any of these lines, without needing to move to the first.

  Take the result of the extract function and run the function

The handlers are handled in order, first to last.
On success, no other handlers are tested.
